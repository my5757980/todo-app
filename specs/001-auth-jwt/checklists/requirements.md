# Specification Quality Checklist: User Authentication & JWT Integration (Phase II)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/sp.plan`.
- "Better Auth" and "JWT" kept out of the spec body — referenced only in branch/PHR metadata. Spec describes the behaviour, not the library.
- Shared-secret requirement (FR-008, SC-007) captures the BETTER_AUTH_SECRET constraint from user input in technology-agnostic terms.
- Out-of-scope items documented: password reset, email verification, social login, account deletion.
